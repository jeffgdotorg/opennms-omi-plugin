EVENT TYPE: TeamQuest SNMP trap

DESCRIPTION: 
Busy_Disk_Alarm is triggered when the disk subsystem can't keep up with a
large number of I/O requests.  It denotes that the system either requires
filesystems to be realigned to reduce I/O pressure or that it should be moved
to a better tier of storage.  The defining metrics are the percent of time
the disk is busy, the disk queue is non-zero, and the disk service time is
above normal thresholds.

Contains a combination of the following metrics:
% Disk Time > 20%
AND Avg. Disk sec/Transfer > 0.015 sec
AND Current Disk Queue Length > 1
Where
% Disk Time - The percentage of elapsed time that the selected disk drive
is busy servicing read or write request.

Avg. Disk sec/Transfer - The average time in seconds of a read or write of 
data from or to the disk.

Current Disk Queue Length - The number of requests outstanding on the disk
at the time the performance data is collected. It includes requests in
service at the time of the snapshot. This is an instantaneous length, not
an average over the time interval.

Multi-spindle disk devices can have multiple requests active at one time,
but other concurrent requests are awaiting service. This counter may reflect
a transitory high or low queue length, but if there is a sustained load on
the disk drive, it is likely that this will be consistently high. Requests
are experiencing delays proportional to the length of this queue minus the
number of spindles on the disks. This difference should average less than
2 for good performance.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Verify resolution of matching Critical Busy_Disk_Alarm.

filesystems to be realigned to reduce I/O pressure or that it should be moved
to a better tier of storage.  The defining metrics are the percent of time
the disk is busy, the disk queue is non-zero, and the disk service time is
above normal thresholds.

Contains a combination of the following metrics:
% Disk Time > 20%
AND Avg. Disk sec/Transfer > 0.015 sec
AND Current Disk Queue Length > 1
Where
% Disk Time - The percentage of elapsed time that the selected disk drive
is busy servicing read or write request.

Avg. Disk sec/Transfer - The average time in seconds of a read or write of 
data from or to the disk.

Current Disk Queue Length - The number of requests outstanding on the disk
at the time the performance data is collected. It includes requests in
service at the time of the snapshot. This is an instantaneous length, not
an average over the time interval.

Multi-spindle disk devices can have multiple requests active at one time,
but other concurrent requests are awaiting service. This counter may reflect
a transitory high or low queue length, but if there is a sustained load on
the disk drive, it is likely that this will be consistently high. Requests
are experiencing delays proportional to the length of this queue minus the
number of spindles on the disks. This difference should average less than
2 for good performance.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Investigate disk performance problem.

DESCRIPTION:
Pct_disk_space_alarm  - indicates a filesystem is filling up.
	Warning - less than 20% free
	Major - less than 10% free
	Critical - less than 5% free

Use this job to monitor the logical disk space usage. This job checks the
percentage of disk space used and the free space in megabytes. This script
raises an event if either the percentage of used space or the free space
(MB) crosses the threshold you specify.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Investigate the disk usage of the specified device, cleanup unneeded files or increase disk space.

EVENT TYPE: TeamQuest SNMP trap

DESCRIPTION: 
Disk/disk partition alarm - triggered when the disk subsystem can't keep up
with a large number of I/O requests.  It denotes that the system either
requires filesystems to be realigned to reduce I/O pressure or that it 
should be moved to a better tier of storage.  The defining metrics are 
the percent of time the disk is busy, the disk queue is non-zero, and the
disk service time is above normal thresholds.

High disk/partition response alarm - triggered when the server experiences
high disk service times unaccompanied by a corresponding high I/O load.  
This points to an external problem such as sharing a SAN LUN with another
server with high I/O requirements or a bottleneck in the SAN network.

contains a combination of the following metrics:
Block Device %busy > 20%
AND avserv > 15 ms
AND avque > 1
Where
Block Device %busy - The percentage of time this device was servicing
a transfer request.
Avserv - The average time in milliseconds for a transfer request to be
completed by this device.
Avque - For systems running IBM AIX 5.3 and higher, the average number of
requests oustanding during the interval. For systems running IBM AIX 5.2
and lower, the number of requests outstanding at the end of the interval.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Verify resolution of Critical Disk Alarm.

EVENT TYPE: TeamQuest SNMP trap

DESCRIPTION:
Disk/disk partition alarm - triggered when the disk subsystem can't keep up
with a large number of I/O requests.  It denotes that the system either
requires filesystems to be realigned to reduce I/O pressure or that it 
should be moved to a better tier of storage.  The defining metrics are 
the percent of time the disk is busy, the disk queue is non-zero, and the
disk service time is above normal thresholds.

High disk/partition response alarm - triggered when the server experiences
high disk service times unaccompanied by a corresponding high I/O load.  
This points to an external problem such as sharing a SAN LUN with another
server with high I/O requirements or a bottleneck in the SAN network.

contains a combination of the following metrics:
Block Device %busy > 20%
AND avserv > 15 ms
AND avque > 1
Where
Block Device %busy - The percentage of time this device was servicing
a transfer request.
Avserv - The average time in milliseconds for a transfer request to be
completed by this device.
Avque - For systems running IBM AIX 5.3 and higher, the average number of
requests oustanding during the interval. For systems running IBM AIX 5.2
Block Device %busy > 20%
AND avserv > 15 ms
AND avque > 1

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Investigate possible disk I/O problem.

EVENT TYPE: TeamQuest SNMP trap

DESCRIPTION:
contains a combination of the following metrics:
Oracle:SystemWait: event == enq: TX - row lock contention
AND Oracle:SystemWait: waittime >= 300 sec
Where
Event (in Oracle SystemWait table) ? The name of the wait event. Waits
for TX in mode 6: occurs when a session is waiting for a row level
lock that is already held by another session. This occurs when one user
is updating or deleting a row, which another session wants to update or
delete. This type of TX enqueue wait corresponds to the wait event enq:
TX - row lock contention.

Waittime (in Oracle SystemWait table) - The amount of time in seconds
spent waiting for this event during the interval. This value is zero
when the Oracle timed_statistics initialization parameter is set to false.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Investigate possible Oracle Row Lock problem.

DESCRIPTION:
Only issued with a severity of Critical.  Describes extremely high CPU
usage based on the following conditions:
- Total CPU usage is greater than 85%
- There is more than 1 process in the run queue
- 1 or more workloads are using more than 40% of the CPU

contains a combination of the following metrics:
CPU %busy > 85%
AND avg-cpuq-sz > 1
Where
%busy - The percentage of time the CPU was not idle.
avg-cpuq-sz - The average length of the run queue per CPU (a queue of processes in memory and runnable).

% Processor Time - A percentage of the elapsed time that a processor is
busy executing a non-idle thread. It can be viewed as the fraction of the
time spent doing useful work. Each processor is assigned an idle thread in
the idle process that consumes those unproductive processor cycles
not used by any other threads.

Processor Queue Length - The instantaneous length of the processor queue
in units of threads. This counter is always 0 unless you are also
monitoring a thread counter. All processors use a single queue in 
which threads wait for processor cycles. This length does not include
the threads that are currently executing. A sustained processor queue 
length greater than 2 generally indicates processor congestion.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Investigate possible CPU utilization problem.

DESCRIPTION:
contains a combination of the following metrics:
% Processor Time > 85%
AND Processor Queue Length > 1
Where
% Processor Time - A percentage of the elapsed time that a processor is
busy executing a non-idle thread. It can be viewed as the fraction of the
time spent doing useful work. Each processor is assigned an idle thread in
the idle process that consumes those unproductive processor cycles
not used by any other threads.

Processor Queue Length - The instantaneous length of the processor queue
in units of threads. This counter is always 0 unless you are also
monitoring a thread counter. All processors use a single queue in 
which threads wait for processor cycles. This length does not include
the threads that are currently executing. A sustained processor queue 
length greater than 2 generally indicates processor congestion.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Investigate possible CPU utilization problem

DESCRIPTION: TeamQuest GoldenGate Alarm

GG_status_alarm – indicates that a GoldenGate sync stream has a status of ABENDED.

GG_lag_alarm – indicates that there is a lag in the GoldenGate sync stream on the receiving server
	Warning – greater than 15 seconds
	Minor – greater than 300 seconds
	Major – greater than 900 seconds
	Critical – greater than 1800 seconds

Lag statistics show you how well the Oracle GoldenGate processes are keeping pace with the 
amount of data that is being generated by the business applications. With this information,
you can diagnose suspected problems and tune the performance of the Oracle GoldenGate processes
to minimize the latency between the source and target databases.

Latency or lag is the period of time that has passed between when a change (DML or DDL) occurred in the source
database and the current point in time. For example, Extract latency is the time that has elapsed since the change
occurred to the source table and the time it was extracted and written to the trail file. Conversely, Replicat latency is
the time that has elapsed from the source table change to the time it was applied to the target database.
The amount of acceptable lag time is dependent on an agreed upon Service Level Agreement (SLA) that states how
much time is allowed to pass between when the data was entered in the source database to the time it appears on
the target database. A lag time of 30+ minutes may be acceptable for offloading data for ad-hoc queries but not for a
banking application that often requires near zero latency.

DESCRIPTION: TeamQuest GoldenGate Alarm

GG_status_alarm – indicates that a GoldenGate sync stream has a status of ABENDED.

GG_lag_alarm – indicates that there is a lag in the GoldenGate sync stream on the receiving server
	Warning – greater than 15 seconds
	Minor – greater than 300 seconds
	Major – greater than 900 seconds
	Critical – greater than 1800 seconds

Lag statistics show you how well the Oracle GoldenGate processes are keeping pace with the 
amount of data that is being generated by the business applications. With this information,
you can diagnose suspected problems and tune the performance of the Oracle GoldenGate processes
to minimize the latency between the source and target databases.

Latency or lag is the period of time that has passed between when a change (DML or DDL) occurred in the source
database and the current point in time. For example, Extract latency is the time that has elapsed since the change
occurred to the source table and the time it was extracted and written to the trail file. Conversely, Replicat latency is
the time that has elapsed from the source table change to the time it was applied to the target database.
The amount of acceptable lag time is dependent on an agreed upon Service Level Agreement (SLA) that states how
much time is allowed to pass between when the data was entered in the source database to the time it appears on
the target database. A lag time of 30+ minutes may be acceptable for offloading data for ad-hoc queries but not for a
banking application that often requires near zero latency.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: Notify Database Services Branch (DSB).
